# monkeypox-disease-prediction
I am addressing the problem related to the recent outbreak of Monkeypox disease. Provided the different type of symptoms of a patient, we need to predict if the person has the Monkeypox disease or not.
For this problem, I am taking the dataset from Kaggle website. 
Link for dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammad4hmed/monkeypox-patients-dataset

I used different machine learning models to apply over this data.
1. Perceptron
2. SVM
3. Logistic Regression 
4. KNN
5. Decision Trees
6. Neural Networks

And compared their performance with different evaluation criteria
